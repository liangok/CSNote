## 第一代

采用深度优先遍历

- 优点：可以较快的找出通往出口的路径
- 缺点：只适合仅有一条通路的迷宫，若有多条路径，由于采用深度搜索实现，在入队时会导致出现闪现问题

```c++
RGW::RGW(int** maze, int start, int end)
{

	start_x = 1;
	end_x = L;
	Map = (int**)malloc(L * sizeof(int*));

	for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
		//calloc:在分配空间时初始化内容
		Map[i] = (int*)calloc(L, sizeof(int));
	}

	start_y = start;
	end_y = end;

	for (int i = 0; i < L; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < L; j++) {
			Map[i][j] = maze[i][j];
		}
	}

	findWay(start_x, start_y);
}
```

```c++
//用深度优先搜索的方法
void RGW::findWay(int x, int y) {
	Pos pos;
	pos.x = x;
	pos.y = y;
	path.enQueue(pos);
	Map[x][y] = WALL;
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		int x_now = x + dirs[i][0];
		int y_now = y + dirs[i][1];
		if (Map[x_now][y_now] == ROUTE) {
			findWay(x_now, y_now);
		}
	}
}
```

## 第二代

```c++
RGW::RGW(int** maze, int start_x, int start_y, int end_x, int end_y, int back_step) {
	this->start_x = start_x;
	this->start_y = start_y;
	this->end_x = end_x;
	this->end_y = end_y;

	findPos(maze, back_step);
}
```

```c++
void RGW::findPos(int** maze, int back_step) {
	srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
	int num = 0;
	int way_out = -1;
	int dir = 0;
	//当前位置
	int x = start_x;
	int y = start_y;
	//要走的位置
	Pos pos;
	pos.x = x;
	pos.y = y;

	//方向标签
	int lable_x = 0;
	int lable_y = 0;

	//计算路径
	while (x != end_x || y != end_y) {
		//更新方向标签
		if (end_x > x) {
			lable_x = RIGHT;
		}
		else if(end_x == x){
			lable_x = ONX;
		}
		else
		{
			lable_x = LEFT;
		}

		if (end_y > y) {
			lable_y = DOWN;
		}
		else if (end_y == y) {
			lable_y = ONY;
		}
		else
		{
			lable_y = UP;
		}

		//检测死胡同
		for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
			pos.x += dirs[i][0];
			pos.y += dirs[i][1];
			if (maze[pos.x][pos.y] == WALL) {
				num++;
			}
			else
			{
				way_out = i;
			}
		}
		
		//老鼠位置优先，x轴方向优先。
		pos.x = x + lable_x;
		pos.y = y + lable_y;

		//可能遇到的几种情况,只有第二第三是可以正常通行的
		if (num == 3) {		//死胡同
			maze[x][y] = DEADEND;
			//更新x, y
			x += dirs[way_out][0];
			y += dirs[way_out][1];
			pos.x = x;
			pos.y = y;
			path.enQueue(pos);
		}
		else if (pos.x > 1 && pos.x < L - 2 && maze[y][pos.x] > WALL && lable_x != 0) {	//猫沿x轴到老鼠的方向没有墙
			pos.y = y;
			path.enQueue(pos);
			x = pos.x;
		}
		else if (pos.y < L - 2 && pos.y > 1 && maze[pos.y][x] > WALL && lable_y != 0) {	//猫沿x轴到老鼠的方向有墙，但沿y轴到老鼠的方向没有墙
			pos.x = x;
			path.enQueue(pos);
			y = pos.y;
		}
		else    //猫位置朝向老鼠的两个方向都是墙，并且是两个挨在一起的情况
		{
			for (int i = 0; i < back_step; i++) {
				pos.x = x + dirs[dir][0];
				pos.y = y + dirs[dir][1];
				while (pos.x > 1 && pos.y < L - 1 && maze[pos.x][pos.y] <= WALL) {
					dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
					pos.x = x + dirs[dir][0];
					pos.y = y + dirs[dir][1];
					path.enQueue(pos);
				}
				x = pos.x;
				y = pos.y;
				path.enQueue(pos);
			}

		}
		printf("x is %d, y is %d, end_x is %d, end_y is %d\n", x, y, end_x, end_y);
		num = 0;	//计数器归零
		way_out = -1;
	}
}
```

在面对稀疏地图时可以使用此方法

在此算法中，会计算当前老鼠距猫的方向是在下方上方，或左方右方，一但判断出来后，就优先往这些方向走，如果一个方向有墙就往另一个接近老鼠的方向走，但是如果两个方向都有墙，就不能这样走了





<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200804121222117.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3dlaXhpbl80MjU5NzA1Nw==,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70" alt="在这里插入图片描述" style="zoom: 33%;" />

首先是第一种情况，三个方向都有墙，可以判断是一个死胡同，可直接把这个位置标记为墙，下一次就不在走这个地方了。

```c++
//检测死胡同
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
	pos.x += dirs[i][0];
	pos.y += dirs[i][1];
	if (maze[pos.x][pos.y] == WALL) {
		num++;
	}
	else
	{
		way_out = i;
	}
}

if (num == 3) {		//死胡同
			maze[x][y] = DEADEND;
			//更新x, y
			x += dirs[way_out][0];
			y += dirs[way_out][1];
			pos.x = x;
			pos.y = y;
			path.enQueue(pos);
}
```

第二中情况，只有面向老鼠的两个方向有墙（图二），这时就不能简单直接将这个位置设为墙了，因为有可能这个位置是一个通道（图三），一旦堵上就把这条通道堵上了，因此就采用转圈发出去。

<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020080412121666.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3dlaXhpbl80MjU5NzA1Nw==,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70" alt="在这里插入图片描述" style="zoom: 25%;" />

让猫由方向计数器控制步长个循环(back_step)，不再考虑老鼠的位置，每次撞到墙方向控制器加一对4取余，这样就可以在这个方框内绕个圈出去。

对于稀疏图（44* 44，打掉600个点），这种算法可以较为快速的找到目标位置的路径，但是对于稠密图，则会遇到其他问题。

如这种情况

<img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200804121209462.png?x-oss-process=image/watermark,type_ZmFuZ3poZW5naGVpdGk,shadow_10,text_aHR0cHM6Ly9ibG9nLmNzZG4ubmV0L3dlaXhpbl80MjU5NzA1Nw==,size_16,color_FFFFFF,t_70" alt="img" style="zoom:25%;" />

猫再往一个方向走发现是墙，就交由方向计数器控制，但是这个框再四个角都有墙，就会导致再框内转圈。因此又改进了第三代。



## 第三代

在求路径函数时， 对于第二版可以较快的解决稀疏图的路径寻址，但是对于在一个方框内且只在方框的一条边的中间有一个出口的情况则会引起猫在这个框内绕圈子，故引入信息素的概念，在遇到猫位置朝向老鼠的两个方向都是墙，并且是两个挨在一起的情况猫位置朝向老鼠的两个方向都是墙，并且是两个挨在一起的情况时，除了绕圈找路外，还会在路中留下一种信息素，这种信息素会提醒猫下次尽量不要来到这里，信息素越浓，提醒的力度越大，并且为了防止只有四个角是两个挨在一起的墙的情况（信息素过大会使原来的路阻断），这种信息素会随时间的推移而褪去（信息素褪去的功能想要实现，但是不会）。



```c++
RGW::RGW(int** maze, int start_x, int start_y, int end_x, int end_y, int back_step, int ABSOLUTE_WALL) {
	this->start_x = start_x;
	this->start_y = start_y;

	this->end_y = end_y;

	findPosV3(maze, back_step, ABSOLUTE_WALL);

```

​	这种方法的墙和路采用一种相对的概念，只有ABSOLUTE_WALL（负值）是绝对的墙，这里在面对面对老鼠的两个方向都是墙时，采用得分制，每次个周围四个方向打分，找的分最高的方向走，果一条路重复走，每走一次，就把这条路的数值减一，这样就会让路变得更像墙，在下次打分时，这个位置的分数就会变低，但是不能低于ABSOLUTE_WALL，这样会把路堵上。

​	如果遇到朝向老鼠的两个方向都是墙时，采用得分制选择方向，首先有delta_x, delta_y，当delta_x,delta_y大于0时可以加分。每次的分数是当前地图的分数加delta_x, delta_y是否大于0，大于0时加一分。并且加上当前路的值最后算出总的分。

因此该算法是可行的，并且在无论是复杂图还是简单图中都可以使用，但缺点是由于在采用得分控制时还是有点过于随机化，会导致计算时间较长，并不适合在此处使用。

## 第四代

​	第二代和第三代都是每一帧都要重新计算猫当前位置到老鼠位置的完整路径，可是猫每次只需取路径里的前几个来走，下一帧又要重新计算整个路径，这样并没有必要，之需每次计算前几步即可。这样就可以大大的简化代码，节省时间。

	this->end_y = end_y;

优点：计算时间较快。

缺点：对于静止的物体会导致撞墙等后果，因此只适用于追捕运动的物体。
